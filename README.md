# GoogleBookSearch
#
## A React search application
#
#
## Technologies: 
This application was built with the MERN stack. 
It uses React on the front-end.
The application was built using the Node Express framework.
The database for saving the searched book list is MongoDB. 
##
#
## Functionality:
The search bar allows searches of the Google Books API - searches performed using axios. 
The results are displayed with an image, a title, authors, and a brief description. 
The view button opens a link to a new page for the book details on Google Play. 
The save button saves the book to My Saved Books.
Use the Navigation bar to see the books in the saved list.
The saved list displays the title, a description, a link to view the book in a new page, and a delete button.

##Challenges : I had hard time getting the saved book details to render to the page, I was able to get the search results to display, but could not get the saved list working. I did verify the books were saving to my database. Time constraints and lack of fundemental understanding of React were my biggest hurdles.
